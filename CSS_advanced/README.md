### Task 0. Let's get some images!

Download 10 high resolution images that look as close to the final product.
The images should all be representative of category they belong to. Images in the ``work`` category should be closely related to ``work``.

File: images/pic-about-01.jpg, images/pic-work-01.jpg, images/pic-work-02.jpg, images/pic-work-03.jpg, images/pic-article-01.jpg, images/pic-article-02.jpg, images/pic-article-03.jpg, images/pic-person-01.jpg, images/pic-person-02.jpg, images/pic-person-03.jpg

### Task 1. Effortless transitions when scrolling

When scrolling is triggered on the ``html`` element itself, weâ€™d like the behavior of the scroll to be as fluid as possible.

File: styles/1-style.css

### Task 2. Do you know your color values?

Based on styles/1-style.css, create the following declarations:

- For the ``body``, set the foreground color value to ``#161616``
- For all anchor elements, set the foreground color value to ``#161616``
- All elements with the class ``visually-hidden`` should have their display to ``none``
- All elements with the class ``card-category``, should have their foreground color set to ``#D73953``
- All elements with the class ``section-tagline`` should have their foreground color set to ``#D73953``
